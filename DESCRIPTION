Description: Utilities that support the use of the fractional airline decomposition routines
    from Demetra version 3 from the rjd3highfreq package, including routines to generate outlier 
    and holiday regressors, assign outlier and calendar regression based factors to different 
    components (as in X-13ARIMA-SEATS), summarize estimated model coefficients, and generate 
    factor plots and boxplots by week. Note that for some routines, series are assumed to be 
    formatted by the tis package, and were developed for use with weekly time series. 
    Plotting routines for weekly series are included, with a high density plotting function 
    for components. Routines have been added that use xts time series objects.
